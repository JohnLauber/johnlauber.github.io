I'm not sure what I'm doing here. I wanted to play with GitHub pages and Jekyll, but I'm still not sure what I plan on posting here. I may utilize my custom johnlauber.com domain, that I never used except for email. Maybe I'll just post code related items here, as that would make sense.

I do know I wanted to blog more after WordCamp US in December, so I guess today is day one.

Happy Blogging!
